# The package
This package implements several (scalable) spatial and spatio-temporal Poisson mixed models for high-dimensional areal count data in a fully Bayesian setting using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) technique.

Below, there is a list with a brief overview of all package functions:

* ```add_neighbour``` Adds isolated areas (polygons) to its nearest neighbour.
* ```CAR_INLA``` Fits several spatial CAR models for high-dimensional count data.
* ```clustering_partition``` Obtain a spatial partition using the DBSC algorithm.
* ```connect_subgraphs``` Merges disjoint connected subgraphs.
* ```divide_carto``` Divides the spatial domain into subregions.
* ```MCAR_INLA``` Fits several spatial multivariate CAR models for high-dimensional count data.
* ```mergeINLA``` Merges inla objects for partition models.
* ```Mmodel_compute_cor``` Computes between-disease correlation coefficients for M-models.
* ```Mmodel_idd``` Implements the spatially non-structured multivariate latent effect.
* ```Mmodel_icar``` Implements the intrinsic multivariate latent effect.
* ```Mmodel_lcar``` Implements the Leroux et al. (1999) multivariate latent effect.
* ```Mmodel_pcar``` Implements the proper multivariate latent effect.
* ```random_partition``` Defines a random partition of the spatial domain based on a regular grid.
* ```STCAR_INLA``` Fits several spatio-temporal CAR models for high-dimensional count data.


# Installation

[Installing Rtools44 for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html)

R version 4.4.0 and newer for Windows requires the new Rtools44 to build R packages with C/C++/Fortran code from source.


## Install from CRAN
```
install.packages("bigDM")
```

## Install from GitHub (development version)
```
# Install devtools package from CRAN repository
install.packages("devtools")

# Load devtools library
library(devtools)

# Install the R-INLA package
install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)

# In some Linux OS, it might be necessary to first install the following packages
install.packages(c("cpp11","proxy","progress","tzdb","vroom"))

# Install bigDM from GitHub repositoy
install_github("spatialstatisticsupna/bigDM")
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE: At least the stable version of INLA 22.11.22 (or newest) must be installed for the correct use of the bigDM package.**
