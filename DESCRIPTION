Description: Implements several spatial and spatio-temporal scalable disease mapping models for high-dimensional count data using the INLA technique for approximate Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models (Orozco-Acosta et al., 2021 <doi:10.1016/j.spasta.2021.100496> and Orozco-Acosta et al., 2022 <arXiv:2201.08323>). The creation and develpment of this package has been supported by Project MTM2017-82553-R (AEI/FEDER, UE) and Project PID2020-113125RB-I00/MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033. It has also been partially funded by the Public University of Navarra (project PJUPNA2001).
